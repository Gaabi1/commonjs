# CommonJS Module Studies

This repository contains my personal study notes and code examples focused on **CommonJS modules** in Node.js.  
It is part of my learning journey in the **Mobile Developer Bootcamp**.

## ðŸ“š What is CommonJS?

CommonJS is a module system used primarily in Node.js. It allows you to:
- Export and import code using `module.exports` and `require`
- Organize your code in reusable files
- Build scalable and maintainable applications

## ðŸš€ Topics Covered

- Introduction to modules in Node.js
- Using `require` and `module.exports`

> All examples are meant for experimentation and practice.

## ðŸŽ“ Bootcamp Context

These exercises are part of my training in the **Mobile Developer Bootcamp**, where I am learning Node.js as a backend tool to support mobile applications.
